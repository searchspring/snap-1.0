## Templates Setup

Snap Templates is an alternative method of creating a Searchspring integration. The documentation in this 'Templates' section is only applicable if you are utilizing the `SnapTemplates` export. While there is overlap across other pages in the documentation, this section aims to outline the differences.

```jsx
import { SnapTemplates } from '@searchspring/snap-preact';
```

Snap Templates allow for rapid integration and customization by utilizing Snap's library of components. The combination of library components make up a template that Searchspring manages and can be further customized by defining a theme.

To get started, we recommend using Snapfu to initialize a project. See Getting Started section.

On the next page in this section, we'll customize the integration via the `SnapTemplates` configuration.
